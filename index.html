					<h2>Hello World</h2>
					
					<img id="logo" src="files/images/mblogo.png" alt="Michael Burnie Logo" align="left" />
					<p>My name is Michael Burnie, and this is my website. Welcome! <strong>I am a dedicated IT professional seeking additional knowledge and experience to achieve success in my field.</strong>
					The IT field is always expanding, and I plan to take advantage of any opportunity I can get. IT is also becoming a part of just about every field out there, and it's bringing everyone
					along by making technology accessible. I've always had a strong inclination towards technology and science, and IT is the culmination of those branches.</p>
					
					<h3>What am I doing?</h3>
					<p>See my <button id='btnProjects' onclick="location.href='#projects'">Current Projects</button>! Right now I am using my website to learn JavaScript and <strong>jQuery</strong>. 
					I wish to experiment with several jQuery effects as well as plugins of which many generous developers have kindly provided online.</p>
					
					<p>The following is a list of the plugins I am currently using or have used on this site previously:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/" target="_blank">Caleb Troughton's Waypoints</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.jacklmoore.com/zoom/" target="_blank">Jack Moore's jQuery Zoom</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://trevordavis.net/blog/jquery-one-page-navigation-plugin" target="_blank">Trevor Davis' One Page Nav</a></li><!--This guy's pic jumped out at me. I clicked 'about' and I was like "Whoa, hey there designer dude."-->
						<li><a href="http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/" target="_blank">Ariel Flesler's ScrollTo</a>
					</ul>	

					<p><em>Special thanks to <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/" target="_blank">Subtle Patterns</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>,
					and <a href="http://responsiveslides.com/" target="_blank">Responsive Slides</a>.</em></p>
					
					<p>I'm also looking into <strong>responsive web design</strong>. I find the simpler sites to be the most appealing, which is why I have everything on one page;
					however, as you can see	from the state of this site, I don't really have an eye for design&#8212;I am a programmer after all. If you have ideas on how to improve my site, let me know!</p>

					<h2>Projects</h2>
					<h3>Current Projects</h3>
					<a href="files/ad.swf">
						<img src="files/images/project/ad.png" alt="Flash Ad" align="right"/>
					</a>
					<p>As I finish my final year of college, I am into much larger projects. The main project this year will be my work with a local treats shop expanding into a provincial and national market.
					I am the product owner of a team of six colleagues. We're redoing their entire site and including a complete web store. We've only just begun but I am very excited for this opportunity!</p>
					
					<p>Other projects include working with Flash for a 2D Animation course, and reworking this website for an Advanced Web course. No doubt this section will be even more full over the next few months! 
					For one of my first assignments, I created a little Flash ad for one of my school's programs. Click the Georgian College logo to see its Flashy magnificence.</p>
					
					<h3>Previous Projects and Assignments</h3>
					<p>In this section, I've included many projects I've worked on throughout college. Many of them were fun experiences to me and full of programming no-no's. Nonetheless,
					I've learned so much from each of them.</p>
					<div class="project-section" id="project-cms">
						<h4>Content Management System</h4>
						<a href="http://webdesign4.georgianc.on.ca/~200198907/comp1006/assignment2/default.php">
							<img src="files/images/project/cms.png" alt="Content Management System" align="right" width="400px" />
						</a>
						<p>One of my first major projects of college was to build a simple CMS with php. It ended up taking longer than I expected, but I had a lot more fun with it than expected too.
						I struggled with the CSS because I didn't have much exposure to it. That's why I went crazy with the gradients.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="project-section" id="project-orbituary">
						<h4>Orbituary</h4>
						<a href="https://github.com/Nyaxite/IntroToGraphicsProject1">
							<img src="files/images/project/orbituary.png" alt="Orbituary" align="right" width="400px" />
						</a>
						<p>Orbituary was a game I made in Python along with a friend. It took of hard work and strange maths. My target for the game was to make it completely scalable;
						for example, you can set the number of enemies that will appear on a given level, and the game will evenly distribute the enemeies throughout the level with a small
						degree of randomness. The game didn't look great or play the best, but there are some good ideas about this project that I will remember.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="project-section" id="project-enterprise-computing">
						<h4>Enterprise Computing Web Application</h4>
						<img src="files/images/project/enterprise_computing.png" alt="Enterprise Computing Web Application" align="right" width="400px" />
						<p>My Enterprise Computing course focused on all of the aspects demonstrated by this project. Using C#, a friend and I created a web application demonstrating all of
						the CRUD operations. We allowed a user to add cars, engines, and manufacturers into a database through a simple GUI. Unfortunately, this project was setup on
						a temporary Windows Azure server, so I do not have a link to the working application.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="project-section" id="project-monumental-math">
						<h4>Monu-mental Math App</h4>
						<a href="https://github.com/Nyaxite/ProjectTwo">
							<img src="files/images/project/monumental_math.png" alt="Monu-mental Math" align="right" width="400px" />
						</a>
						<p>A friend and I created this simple Android app that has two game modes (Mental Math and Fleeting Figures) based around math. Using Java, we created this simple yet slightly addictive game to
						test your quick thinking and memorization abilities.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="project-section" id="project-coin-collector">
						<h4>Coin Collector</h4>
						<a href="https://github.com/Nyaxite/IntroToGraphicsAssignment4">
							<img src="files/images/project/side_scroller.png" alt="Side Scroller" align="right" width="400px" />
						</a>
						<p>One of the simplest yet most fun games I made. This was also made with Python. You simply steer the red car with your pointer around obstacles such as wreckage and cars (both with and oncoming traffic).
						Try to collect as many coins as you can before you inevitably explode (unless you're really good)! You get bonuses for certain pickups, like a star that gives you invulnerability (wonder where I got that idea from).</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="project-section" id="project-slot-machine">
						<h4>Slot Machine</h4>
						<a href="https://github.com/Nyaxite/IntroToGraphicsAssignment2">
							<img src="files/images/project/slot_machine.png" alt="Slot Machine" align="right" width="400px" />
						</a>
						<p>One last Python game I made using winning percentages based on actual slot machines. This slot machine is a simple and far less risky method of gambling than your standard machine.
						It's also far more ugly, but it works!</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="project-section" id="games">
					<h3>Minigames</h3>
					<p>I got bored and started programming some very simple things with JavaScript.</p>
						<div id="math-game" class="game">
							<h3>Math Game</h3>
							<p>Answer the following question made from pseudo-randomness:</p>

					<h2>Services</h2>
					<p>I am an IT professional. I am exploring opportunities to find the most suitable job in this field for me, so I am more than willing to take part in any IT job I can. 
					I can provide consultation or programming services to the following:</p>
					<h3>Programming</h3>
					<p>I'm currently attending my third and final year at Georgian College for Computer Programming. I've learned basics of several programming languages and I'm earger to delve deeper into them.
					Some of the languages include Java, C#, and Python. I learn quickly and I'm more than happy to take on almost any programming jobs.</p>
					<h3>E-commerce</h3>
					<p>I've had great exposure to E-commerce through co-operative experiences. I'm still working with a business that produces open-source E-commerce software, and will continue to do so as
					E-commerce becomes the primary method of shopping.</p>
					<h3>Web Design</h3>
					<p>I have experience coding with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, as hopefully demonstrated by this site. I wish to explore Web Design in greater detail, but I require new tasks to build my portfolio.
					I'm confident I can build strong websites and quickly adapt to tools and frameworks as required.</p>
					<h3>Project Management</h3>
					<p>I've been given opportunities in at my current work to get a taste of Project Management. Alongside the Project Management course I've taken, I hope to eventually become a PMP once I've earned the
					required hours.</p>
